        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
        I come from a background of being a first generation student from an immigrant family that took the risk moving to America after the Vietnam conflict. A lot of my inspiration and introduction to STEM was through famous science educators such as Carl Sagan, Bill Nye, Neil Degrasse Tyson, and the Mythbusters. 
        Since those days, I have dreamt of being an impactful part of humankind's engimatic understanding of the universe and what it entails. I have developed a reputation of being driven to pursue things that are inherently difficult and an individual that is motivated to solve complex problems.
        During my undergraduate work, I participated in many aeropace organizations that exposed my interest in rocket engine development, testing frameworks, and the greater research involvment. These experiences had opened an opportunity to be in a full-time contracting position with 
        NASA's Advance Space Power and Propulsion at the Marshall Space Flight Center where I serve as a test engineer. My work entails providing intstrumentation support, testing operations, and engineering support
        for Nasa's ongoing nuclear propulsion development. My role also extends to providing robotics, software, and control systems expertise in conjunction with my developing propulsion knowledge base.
        </p>
        <p>
        I hold a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin with an interest in pursuing a master's program in aerospace or flight test engineering. 
        Through my education, I provide specialization in mechatronics with a certifcation minor in business
        </p>
        <p>
        Outside of engineering and aerospace, I enjoy playing music(trumpet and piano), cooking, programming, reading, hiking, climbing, model-making, and high-powered rocketry.
